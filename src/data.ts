    "3) Airdrops - Future airdrops for holders using high profile commissioned artists to collaborate with. The artists would be commissioned by the team and can bring value through recognition of collaboration, but also through awesome digital art in the NFT space.",
    "4) Crypto - With passing trading milestones, we could allocate some of the sales commissions towards crypto investments. We could put it in at an entry price and decide on how many x until we take it out. Rinse and repeat until the community decides to evenly distribute it. It would be a fun way to try hit on small projects in hope of moonshots, or stick to traditional blue chips.",
